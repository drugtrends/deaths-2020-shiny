<h3>Remoteness area</h3><p>In the COD URF from 2011 onwards, data on the geographic location of usual residence of a deceased person is available at the Statistical Area 2 (SA2) level from the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) (cat. no. 1270.0.55.001). Data from 2009 and 2010 were originally coded using the Australian Standard Geographic Classification (ASGC) (cat no 1216.0), while data from 2011 to 2015 were coded using ASGS 2011 and from 2016 onwards, ASGS 2016 was used. Correspondence was applied to the 2009 and 2010 ASGC codes by ABS to obtain corresponding ASGS 2011 codes, which could have introduced some inaccuracies and should be considered when interpreting the data.</p>
<p>To reassign data from ASGS to Remoteness Areas (RA), we applied appropriate correspondences (SA2 2011 to RA 2016 for data between 2009 and 2015, and SA2 2016 to RA 2016 for data from 2016 onwards). Five classes of remoteness area are defined nationally for Australia – Major cities, Inner regional, Outer regional, Remote and Very remote. We have disaggregated by Major cities versus Regional and Remote for reporting by state for New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. There are no Major cities in Tasmania and Northern Territory and numbers in Regional and Remote areas are too small for reporting in Australian Capital Territory.</p>

<h3>Drug-induced deaths defined by underlying cause of death (UCOD) codes</h3><p>A <a href="https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/Latestproducts/3303.0Appendix22018?opendocument&amp;tabname=Notes&amp;prodno=3303.0&amp;issue=2018&amp;num=&amp;view=">Tabulation list</a>of ICD-codes to identify causes of death attributable to drug-induced mortality was developed by the ABS based on a drug-induced death tabulation created by United States Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). We have adopted these codes for our definition of all drug-induced deaths as given below.
