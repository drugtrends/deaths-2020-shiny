<small><p>These figures show opioid-induced deaths that were exclusively attributed to <i>Heroin</i>, opioid-induced deaths that were exclusively attributed to <i>Other opioids</i> (i.e. natural and semi-synthetic opioids, synthetic opioids), opioid-induced deaths that were attributed to both <i>Heroin & other opioids</i>, and the rest attributed to only <i>Opium & unspecified opioids</i>. Opioid-induced deaths are defined as deaths where opioid toxicity was considered to be the underlying cause.</p><p>Causes of death data undergo a revision process. Data for 2019 and 2020 are preliminary and subject to another two rounds of revision. Data for 2018 are revised and subject to another round of revision. Data for 2017 and earlier years are final. Data with number of deaths less than or equal to 5 have been suppressed (i.e. not presented). For this reason, percentages may not add up to 100%.</p></small>
