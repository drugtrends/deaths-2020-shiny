<small><p>Deaths directly related to tobacco (ICD-10 – F17) or alcohol (ICD-10 – F10) have been excluded from the analysis. Causes of death data undergo a revision process. Data for 2019 and 2020 are preliminary and subject to another two rounds of revision. Data for 2018 are revised and subject to another round of revision. Data for 2017 and earlier years are final. Data with number of deaths less than or equal to 5 have been suppressed (i.e. not presented).</p>
<p>2009 and 2010 data were coded using the Australian Standard Geographic Classification (ASGC) (ABS cat no 1216.0). 2011 data onwards is coded using the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) (ABS cat. no. 1270.0.55.001) to Statistical Area 2 (SA2) level. Correspondence was applied to the 2009 and 2010 data by ABS to obtain corresponding ASGS codes, which would have introduced some inaccuracies and should be considered when interpreting the data. We applied ABS correspondence between ASGS at SA2 level and remoteness area to derive number of deaths in each remoteness area. Number of deaths in the data were rounded to the nearest integer. Refer to the ABS website for more information on geography standards and correspondences. Percentages in each year does not add up to 100% because a small percentage of deaths cannot be allocated to a remoteness area.</p>
<p>NOTE: Estimates by remoteness area for Northern Territory, Tasmania, and Australian Capital Territory are suppressed as numbers are small. Percentages by remoteness area are only shown for <i>All ages</i>.</p></small>
