<small><p>These data refer to deaths where opioid toxicity was considered to be the underlying cause of death. Causes of death data undergo a revision process. Data for 2019 and 2020 are preliminary (indicated by '<b>x</b>' in most of the plots) and subject to another two rounds of revision. Data for 2018 are revised (indicated by '<b>o</b>' in most of the plots) and subject to another round of revision. Data for 2017 and earlier years are final. Data with number of deaths less than or equal to 5 have been suppressed (i.e. not presented). In accordance with recommendations to ensure stability of age-standardised rates from sparse data, age-standardised rates were not calculated if the total number of deaths was less than or equal to 10. Suppressed data are visible as gaps in the data series.</p>
<p><i>Natural and semi-synthetic opioids</i> include morphine, oxycodone and codeine (ICD-10 Code T40.2). <i>Synthetic opioids</i> include fentanyl, tramadol and pethidine (ICD-10 Code T40.4). <i>Other and unspecified opioids</i> comprise opioid-induced deaths that are not attributed to specific opioids (ICD-10 Code T40.6).</p>
<p>Data on <i>Other and unspecified opioids</i> are not available for <i>Intentional intent</i> and <i>Undetermined intent</i> due to small numbers.</p>
<p>Data are not available for all intent types for some opioids in the 10-year age group categories (i.e. 15-24, 25-34, etc). Refer to Notes tab for details.</p>
<p>Plots also showing "<i>All drug-induced deaths</i>" display data on drug-induced deaths involving the corresponding opioid type. For your information, these data on drug-induced deaths are also shown under the plots for "<i>Drug-induced deaths by drug and age</i>".</p></small>
