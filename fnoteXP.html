<small><p>Deaths directly related to tobacco (ICD-10 – F17) or alcohol (ICD-10 – F10) have been excluded from the analysis. Causes of death data undergo a revision process. Data for 2019 and 2020 are preliminary and subject to another two rounds of revision. Data for 2018 are revised and subject to another round of revision. Data for 2017 and earlier years are final. Data with number of deaths less than or equal to 5 have been suppressed (i.e. not presented). Suppressed data categories due to small number of deaths are not shown in the plots. Empty bars are shown where no deaths were identified in that year of data for the jurisdiction.</p></small>
