<small><p>These figures show opioid-induced deaths that were exclusively attributed to <i>Heroin</i>, opioid-induced deaths that were exclusively attributed to <i>Other opioids</i> (i.e. natural and semi-synthetic opioids, synthetic opioids), opioid-induced deaths that were attributed to both <i>Heroin & other opioids</i>, and the rest attributed to only <i>Opium & unspecified opioids</i>. Opioid-induced deaths are defined as deaths where opioid toxicity was considered to be the underlying cause.</p><p>Causes of death data undergo a revision process. Data for 2019 and 2020 are preliminary (indicated by '<b>x</b>' in most of the plots) and subject to another two rounds of revision. Data for 2018 are revised (indicated by '<b>o</b>' in most of the plots) and subject to another round of revision. Data for 2017 and earlier years are final. Data with number of deaths less than or equal to 5 have been suppressed (i.e. not presented). In accordance with recommendations to ensure stability of age-standardised rates from sparse data, age-standardised rates were not calculated if the total number of deaths was less than or equal to 10. Suppressed data are visible as gaps in the data series.</p><p>NOTE: Data unavailable for <i>Intentional intent</i> for <i>Other and unspecified opioids</i>.</p></small>
