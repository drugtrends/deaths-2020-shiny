<small><p>These figures shows opioid-induced deaths with other drugs (e.g. benzodiazepines, alcohol) contributing to the death. Opioid-induced deaths are defined as deaths where opioid toxicity was considered to be the underlying cause. Causes of death data undergo a revision process. Data for 2019 and 2020 are preliminary (indicated by '<b>x</b>' in most of the plots) and subject to another two rounds of revision. Data for 2018 are revised (indicated by '<b>o</b>' in most of the plots) and subject to another round of revision. Data for 2017 and earlier years are final. Data with number of deaths less than or equal to 5 have been suppressed (i.e. not presented). In accordance with recommendations to ensure stability of age-standardised rates from sparse data, age-standardised rates were not calculated if the total number of deaths was less than or equal to 10. Suppressed data are visible as gaps in the data series.</p>
<p>Plots also showing "<i>All drug-induced deaths</i>" display data on drug-induced deaths involving the corresponding drug. For your information, these data on drug-induced deaths are also shown under the plots for "<i>Drug-induced deaths by drug, jurisdiction and sex</i>" or "<i>Drug-induced deaths by drug and age</i>".</p>
<p>NOTE: Data for opioid with <i>antiepileptic & sedative-hypnotic drugs, unspecified</i>are unavailable for the years before 2015 due to small numbers.</p></small>
