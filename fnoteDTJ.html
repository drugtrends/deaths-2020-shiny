<small><p>Deaths directly attributable to tobacco (ICD-10 – F17) or alcohol (ICD-10 – F10) have been excluded from the analysis. Results presented here include alcohol only as a substance present in drug-induced deaths. Causes of death data undergo a revision process. Data for 2019 and 2020 are preliminary (indicated by '<b>x</b>' in most of the plots) and subject to another two rounds of revision. Data for 2018 are revised (indicated by '<b>o</b>' in most of the plots) and subject to another round of revision. Data for 2017 and earlier years are final. Data with number of deaths less than or equal to 5 have been suppressed (i.e. not presented). In accordance with recommendations to ensure stability of age-standardised rates from sparse data, age-standardised rates were not calculated if the total number of deaths was less than or equal to 10. Suppressed data are visible as gaps in the data series.</p><p>Presented here are drug-induced deaths where a substance from a broader drug class (in CAPITAL LETTERS) or particular drug type (in lowercase letters) was present in drug-induced death. Note, multiple drugs may be involved in one death. Refer to Notes tab for examples of drugs commonly assigned to each category.</p><p>NOTE: Data by state/territory and by sex are only available for <i>All ages</i> and only for <i>All</i> and <i>Unintentional</i> as intent.</p></small>
